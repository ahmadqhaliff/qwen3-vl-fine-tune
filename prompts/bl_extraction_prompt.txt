From the image, extract the following details and return them as a JSON object with these exact keys (do not change or modify these keys):
'consignee_name', 'bl_number', 'port_of_loading', 'port_of_discharge', 'vessel_name', 'detention_free_days', 'demurrage_free_days', 'combined_free_days', 'container_details', 'total_expected_containers'

CRITICAL FREE DAYS EXTRACTION RULES:
1. For statements like '14 DEMURRAGE AND 7 DETENTION FREE DAYS COMBINED':
   - Extract demurrage_free_days = '14'
   - Extract detention_free_days = '7'
   - combined_free_days should be empty, as both values are separately specified
2. Only use combined_free_days when a single number applies to both (e.g., '7 FREE DAYS COMBINED')
3. Never put the same number in multiple fields unless explicitly stated
4. If demurrage OR detention is explicitly mentioned but the other isn't, only populate the mentioned field

CONSIGNEE RULES:
- If consignee is listed as 'TO THE ORDER' or 'SAME AS NOTIFY PARTY', use the notify party's name instead
- Otherwise, use the name listed under consignee
- Use standard Malaysian company name format

CONTAINER DETAILS RULES:
- Identify all unique container numbers (e.g., MSKU1234567).
- For each identified container number, determine its specific size (e.g., 20, 40) and type (e.g., GP, HC, RF).
- This information might be found directly next to an individual container number (e.g., 'MSKU1234567/20GP','MSKU1234567/GP20') OR in a summary format (e.g., '10 x 20GP', meaning 10 containers of that size/type).
- If a summary format like '10 x 20GP' is provided, and 10 distinct container numbers are also listed, associate the '20' size and 'GP' type with each of those 10 container numbers in the output.
- If a mix of summaries is present (e.g., '2 x 20GP', '3 x 40HC') and a corresponding total number of containers are listed, assign sizes and types accordingly. Prioritize explicit individual assignments if present.
- The final output for containers must be a list of objects under the 'container_details' key. Each object in this list must contain 'container_number', 'container_size', and 'container_type' keys.
- If a container's size or type cannot be definitively determined from the image, use an empty string '' for those fields for that specific container object.

TOTAL EXPECTED CONTAINERS RULES:
- Extract the total number of containers expected based on summary statements like '10 x 20GP', '2 x 20GP + 3 x 40HC', etc. This should be an integer.
- For example, if the document states '10 x 20GP', total_expected_containers should be 10.
- If it states '2 x 20GP and 3 x 40HC', total_expected_containers should be 5 (2+3).
- If no such summary statement is found, or if it's ambiguous, return null or do not include the key.

FIELD DETAILS:
- 'consignee_name': (text) The consignee's name. If it is 'to the order' or 'same as notify party', use the notify party's name.
- 'bl_number': (text) The Bill of Lading (BL) number.
- 'port_of_loading': (text) The port where the shipment was loaded.
- 'port_of_discharge': (text) The port where the shipment will be unloaded. Must be one of: Port Klang, Pasir Gudang, Port Tanjung Pelepas, or Penang.
- 'vessel_name': (text) Name of the vessel and voyage number (e.g., GRACE BRIDGE 2306)
- 'detention_free_days': (integer) Number of days for container free time detention. If there is none, return ''
- 'demurrage_free_days': (integer) Number of days for container free time demurrage. If there is none, return ''
- 'combined_free_days': (integer) Number of days for container free time combined. If there is none, return ''
- 'container_details': (list of objects) Each object includes 'container_number' (text), 'container_size' (text), 'container_type' (text).
- 'total_expected_containers': (integer) Total count from summary statements. If not clearly stated, return null or omit.

Return ONLY the JSON object. No additional text.
